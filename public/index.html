                            <p>Drapery and valances add a touch of luxury to a room that few other home furnishings can equal. Sumptuous fabrics, whether simple and refined or boldly scaled and vividly colored, reflect your sense of fashion and style. <br><br>Luscious drops of exotic fabrics can add importance to a fabulous great room and a dramatic valance can bring a romantic touch to the bedroom.<br><br>Natural fabrics styled with clean, uncluttered lines reflect an urban sensibility, yet add softness and sophistication to a contemporary home.<br><br> Whatever your style, we bring you a collection of textiles from all over the world that will allow you to express yourself with a design that is personal and exquisitely unique to your home. Combined with the most up-to-date drapery hardware, almost any type of window opening can become a work of art!<br><br>Whether fashioned into stationary side panels that frame a window opening or into fully operational styles that allow for privacy and light control, there are hundreds of new designs and styles that bring draperies into your décor in very fresh, modern new ways. Valances can add drama and depth but may also serve to camouflage hard treatments and wall space above the window. Narrow, upholstered "pocket" cornices all but seem to disappear as they conceal roller shades over large sliding glass doors.Today's new loft-style homes require that drapery become multi-functional as a means for privacy both from the exterior and the interior of the space. New high-tech solutions in hardware allow clean, minimal lines in the drapery design and function. <br><br>The terrace has become a seamless extension of the living and entertaining areas of your home. Never has there been a wider array of color and pattern in water and stain-resistant fabrics for draperies and coordinating upholstery around the pool, on the patio or in the loggia. <br><br>Draperies have never been more popular! Their superior functionality for light and acoustical control offer window treatment solutions that at the same time, add so much to the beauty, personality and ambiance of your home!<b/></p><br>

                            <h3>Roller Shades</h3>
                            <p><b>With a whisper of light and color, solar fabrics light-filtering qualities diffuse light, reduce glare and control solar heat gain yet maintain excellent outward visibility to make any room a more comfortable environment. Solar fabrics come in roller shades or as Roman-style shades and are perfect for large openings.<br><br>Solar shades reduce the fading of textiles and interior furnishing by significantly blocking harmful UV rays. While lighter color fabrics reflect light and illuminate the interior with just the right amount of light, darker fabrics provide a superb view to the outside and absorb light making them ideal for viewing computer and television screens. Using advances in polyester yarn development, a unique twill weave has been developed that allows a distinct two-sided appearance that remains neutral white to the outside while a darker color to the inside for superior visibility and solar heat reduction.<br><br>The openness of a fabric refers to the weave or mesh structure and determines the amount of heat and light that enters a room. Solar fabrics are offered in a variety of openness factors (1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 25%) to allow optimal light in or to provide more privacy.<br><br>The simple yet beautiful weaves add a rich, subtle texture without taking away from the overall interior design scheme. A recently introduced novelty jacquard line offers an array of unique textures and rich colors inspired by nature. Simple, clean and classic, the aesthetic quality of solar shades allows them to be used in combination with other draperies and window coverings. Made of vinyl-coated fiberglass yarns, our classic solar fabrics are durable and handle high-traffic applications with ease. A heavy duty vinyl-coated polyester style can be used for outdoor applications. Solar fabrics meet or exceed flame retardant standards and are bacteria/fungal resistant. They require only occasional cleaning using a mild detergent, brushing, rinsing.</b></p>
                           <h3>Roman Shades</h3>
                           <p><b>A window treatment that looks fresh and new, but feels as comfortable as an old classic; roman shades reflect the roots of modernism with their crisp, clean lines.<br><br>As the popularity of drapery and soft treatments continues to grow, the popularity of roman shades increases in kind. Styles and fabric vary from casual to couture, allowing these shades to function as a complete window treatment.  Both classic and contemporary, roman shades offer a clean and sophisticated look. Roman shades are extremely versatile - they can stand alone as the only treatment on the window, or they can be used in tandem with drapery panels, cornices and valances. They use the minimum amount of fabric to cover a given window yet, they give so many different degrees of light blocking.<br><br>  A classic roman shade resembles a roller shade when lowered, yet takes on overlaying folds when raised. A "hobbled" roman shade allows you to maintain the beauty of the overlaying folds even when the shade is lowered. European-style "London-shades" have a soft, balloon-shaped bottom that creates an elegant, feminine finish.<br><br>Because roman shades can be made in your own fabric selections means that they can easily coordinate with any décor. Interest has grown in roman shades with seamless sheer styles for large windows as well as shades with blackout linings for bedrooms.  <br><br>Roman shades are ideal for children's rooms. When pulled up, they offer the softness of a valance, and when down, they can provide a room-darkening solution for napping.<br><br>New hand woven, natural shades provide texture and sun control without obscuring natural light. Made from renewable and sustainable natural materials, they are an important choice for those embracing a more eco-friendly lifestyle.    <br><br>Solar control fabrics, such as Phifers' collection of sheerweaves,   can be fabricated in much wider widths using roman shade construction as opposed to traditional roller shades that have to be seamed. This is especially important in new high-rise construction where floor to ceiling glass walls require especially over-sized shades to control heat and glare without compromising the view. However, these types of oversized shades require motorization.</b></p>

                           <h3>Natural Shades</h3>
                           <p><b>Woven woods, or natural shades, bring a fresh perspective on nature into the home, creating a tropical charm and beauty. Reflecting a change in design trends to sustainable natural materials, grasses, reeds, palms, jute, woods and bamboo all translate to luxurious window coverings with a unique appeal of the exotic.<br><br>A new generation of woven woods reflects a softer, more fabric-like blend of materials as well. Rich textures and color variations make the product more attractive and visually interesting.<br><br>Woven woods are most popular as roman-style shades. A classic roman shade resembles a roller shade when lowered, yet takes on overlaying folds when raised. A "hobbled" roman shade allows you to maintain the beauty of the overlaying folds even when the shade is lowered.<br><br>A matching valance conceals the operating mechanism. For wide openings, multiple shades can be mounted on one headrail with one continuous valance across all the shades.<br><br>Alternatively, the shade can have the lift control cord behind the shade with no valance for a very clean, modern look.<br><br>Sliding panels are becoming increasingly popular and can also serve as unique room dividers in open loft spaces. Specialty shapes including arches and angles are also available.<br><br>A variety of designer options include valance styles, decorative trims and finishes and a wide array of fabric edge bandings.<br><br>Privacy and room-darkening liners increase light blockage and offer a neutral outside appearance. Optional top-down/bottom-up and continuous cord loop lift systems enhance shade operation.</b></p>
                           <h3>Honeycomb Shades</h3>
                           <p><b>Honeycomb or "cellular" shades are offered in luxurious woven fabrics in 100's of rich, vibrant colors to match any room décor. A full range of opacities, from a gentle light-softening effect to total privacy and blackout combined with the latest technologies in lifting systems make honeycomb shades one of the most versatile window treatments available.<br><br> Honeycomb shades are one of the best solutions for large openings and sliding glass doors. Because the shades are so lightweight, widths are available up to 174", even in blackout! This eliminates the light leakage that results between multiple shade panels. Many other types of window shade products are too heavy to fabricate in one piece for large openings.<br><br>Advanced lifting systems can eliminate the need for costly motorization options in larger sized shades. <br><br>Cellular shades can also be fabricated as gliding panels, an especially popular solution for heavy-traffic sliding patio doors. "Top-down, bottom-up" technology allows you to view out the window, let natural light shine in, but still maintain privacy!<br><br>Arches, circles, angles and specialty shapes become simple projects with honeycomb shades. Typically people cover these odd-shaped windows because they are experiencing significant problems with heat gain, sun fading or glare. Fully functioning shades can also be customized for skylights. Cordless shades are perfect for sidelights at a doorway. <br><br>Honeycomb shades are extremely effective in blocking ultraviolet rays, or UV. UV, entering the home as sunlight, damages furnishings. In time it fades wood floors, furniture upholstery, draperies, carpeting and artwork. Prolonged exposure to sunlight causes natural, undyed fabrics to turn yellow, making them look old and worn prematurely. <br><br>In South Florida's tropical weather, energy-efficient window treatments translate into year-round savings. Honeycomb shades have an above-average "Summer Shading Coefficient", a measurement of a product's ability to shade against heat gain. They are also unique in that they are highly rated for sound absorption.</b></p>
                           <h3>Blackout Shades</h3>
                           <p><b>Room-darkening window treatments are almost always requested in bedrooms; however, other needs might include rooms with collectible art, books or antiques, or theatre-style media rooms.<br><br>There is a significant difference between window treatments that are "room-darkening" and that are "blackout." Room-darkening allows for a tranquil, shaded ambience in the room with very minimal light. Blackout quality indicates that there is no light allowed in the room at all.<br><br>Many hard window treatments, i.e. shades and blinds, may have either a room-darkening or blackout capability. This is generally achieved by choosing a privacy liner or "no-holes" option. Honeycomb shades have varying opacities from semi-sheer to opaque as well as a blackout quality that is achieved with a light-blocking coating inside the cells of the shade. Blackout roller shades are one of the most popular blackout options.<br><br>Draperies and valances can be lined and interlined with various styles of linings to achieve different degrees of darkness within the room. Thermal linings can allow solar and heat protection without completely blocking all light within the room while blackout linings create "hotel-style" darkness. Drapery side panels are frequently used in combination with hard window treatments to control light leakage that occurs at the sides of shades mounted inside the window opening.</b></p>
                           <h3>Soft Shades</h3>
                           <p><b>Extraordinarily beautiful window treatments, sheer horizontal blinds, also known as window shadings are fabric panels or slats suspended horizontally between two sheer fabric facings. Window shadings offer the functionality of standard horizontal blinds, while the sheer fabric brings the soft beauty of sheer drapes.<br><br>Sheer fabric allows full exterior visibility, the warmth of filtered light and reduced glare when shadings are fully lowered and open. Full privacy or room darkening effects can be achieved when the solid fabric slats are tilted closed. <br><br>The shadings completely disappear into the headrail when fully raised and are now available in 2", 3" and 4" vane size. A sophisticated color palette including soft textural weaves and high-impact metallic fabrics afford the latest in design trends. Hunter Douglas’  "Silhouette" and the newer, “Pirouette”, are the leaders in this type of shading. <br><br>You can further enhance the appearance and function of custom shadings through: <br><br><i>Tilt-Only Low-Profile system</i><br>The Tilt-Only Low-Profile hardware system is 60 percent smaller than the standard Tilt-Only system when tilted closed. The sleeker system fits perfectly with French doors and sidelights, allowing you to open French doors more easily, without a headrail hitting the wall. The optional tilt wand removes all lifting system cords for added safety in homes with children and pets <br><br><i>Top-Down/Bottom-Up</i> <br>The ultimate in versatility, top-down/bottom-up window treatments offer you the ability to operate shades and shadings from the top down, the bottom up or in combination to meet all your privacy needs while still giving you access to natural light.<br><br><i>EasyRise</i><br>EasyRise continuous cord loop system is the easy way to lift and lower the shades. Available on window coverings up to 174" wide, EasyRise operates with a continuous cord loop and clutch assembly, providing the mechanical advantage needed to raise large shades.</b></p>

                            <p>Large oversized shades can create a very clean, uncluttered appearance, especially in floor-to-ceiling applications across large expanses of glass versus a series of smaller, more numerous shades in the same area. The disadvantage to the larger shades is the weight when operating them. Managing heavy window treatments is the primary purpose of motorization.<br><br>  Not only are shades more aesthetically pleasing when they are larger, but they are more effective in providing solar control and privacy because they eliminate light leakage between fewer panels. Operating shades electronically reduces wear and tear on the lift systems of heavier shades by avoiding tugging and uneven torque.<br><br>Motorization is also an important option for hard-to-reach shades at skylights or transom windows. It can be an important option to facilitate operating draperies behind heavy furniture. It is an efficient option when it is necessary to operate a large number of shades or draperies simultaneously within a given space.<br><br>Motorization is also safe and reliable; all of our motors and controls are UL and CSA approved for safe operation, while utilizing very little energy.   New options in Lithium-battery operated motors are now available that interface with the same radio-control remote control. Another extremely important safety factor for residential blinds and shades is that window treatment automation eliminates hanging cords, which can be dangerous around small children and pets.<b/></p><br>

                            <hr class="colored">
                            <p>Since 2004, highly personalized service, impeccable attention to detail, a wide variety of quality products and on-time professional installation have all combined to make Oceanview Shades and Drapery the leading high-end window treatment design firm in South Florida!   <br><br>  Beginning in a small design studio located in Miami's internationally recognized Design District, the company grew exclusively by word of mouth referrals and an extensive website inviting the consumer to request an "In-Home Consultation".<br><br>Each of Oceanview's consultants is professionally trained in the technical aspects of window treatment applications and specifications.  Providing clients the answers to their questions is essential so that they can make an informed decision on the products that will provide solutions and complete the design aesthetic that is right for them.  <br><br>The company relocated in 2012 from the Design District and opened a "gallery/showroom" destination in Coral Gables where both homeowners and design professionals can find outstanding presentations of the latest product ideas in high-end, custom window treatments and specialty home décor finishes.  <br><br>Products and services are showcased in a highly stylized manner to create an exciting environment for the client to have an inspirational and tactile experience with the decorating opportunities the products allow.<br><br>Motorized drapery and automated shade systems are a must for homes where luxury is a way of life. The unique “Imagination Bar” demonstrates new wireless technology that also brings automated lighting systems, whole-house music systems, and updates to an existing home theater without major disruption to the home! <br><br>The company continues to send highly trained and talented decorators to visit the homeowner and assist with appropriate window treatment and design schemes. Other home décor categories including custom bedding, accent pillows, and wall coverings are available. Additional services including specialty paint finishes, upholstery, rugs, lighting and small accessories complete the project. The company has developed long time relationships with superior quality vendors and highly experienced tradesmen to support these efforts.<b/></p><br>
